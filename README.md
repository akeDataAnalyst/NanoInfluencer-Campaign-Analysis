## Strategic Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following tactical actions are recommended for Customer Success and Product teams:

- **Scale High-Reach Markets**  
  Double down on nano-influencer recruitment in France, which shows the highest organic reach (6.97% ER) and lowest entry cost.

- **Optimize Reward ROI**  
  Shift budget toward Sample Product rewards during initial recruitment.  
  These yield the lowest CPE ($0.07) — enabling 3.4× more engagement than Full Size sets for the same budget.

- **Refine Product KPIs**  
  For Skincare brands, prioritize Saves over Likes, as Saves indicate stronger long-term purchase intent and community health.
